# --Privacy Policy--
Liftez App only uses user info for the purpose and sending/sharing regimens via email that are created within the app in HTML email format with a PDF attachment of that email content. We do not collect or store personal data for any other purpose at this time.

# --Tech Stack--
 Expo Go/React Native
 Typescript
 Django Restframework (possibly)

# --Goals--
 Develop another React Native App with more direction and complete it.  
 Create a better way for me to log and track my meals than using the iphone notes app

# --App features/implementations--
 1. Open text like any text editor
 2. Add/remove/edit entries, each entry opens a text editor
 3. Store entries locally on my iPhone or backend sorted by date
 4. Entries allow for lists, descriptions, titles, goal setting, etc much like a jira sprint
 5. Offload the app so it can be used offline at any given moment
